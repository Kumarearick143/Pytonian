üîÆ Purpose

The QuantumField class defines a learnable quantum field operator over discrete classical data. It's designed to:

Encode data into a quantum field representation via spectral (Fourier) methods.

Learn field modes per spatial dimension.

Apply renormalization via learnable cutoffs on mode amplitudes.


This module is fundamental to treating input data as evolving quantum fields over time or geometry.


---

üß† Core Concepts

Modes: Learnable parameters representing excitation modes in the field (like momenta in Fourier space).

Cutoff: A threshold to suppress small/irrelevant field fluctuations (renormalization concept).

Spectral evolution: A transformation where input data is projected into frequency space, modulated by learnable physics, and then reprojected into real space.

anneal_start	Epoch when annealing begins (factor = 1.0)
anneal_end	Epoch when annealing ends (factor = 0.0)
last_epoch	For restoring state (PyTorch compatibility)


Behavior:

From anneal_start to anneal_end, the learning rate linearly decreases.

Before anneal_start: learning rate is unchanged.

After anneal_end: learning rate drops to zero.



---

üîπ get_lr method

def get_lr(self):

This function defines how learning rates evolve per epoch:

if current_epoch < self.anneal_start:
    factor = 1.0

    factor = 0.0
else:
    factor = 1.0 - (current_epoch - self.anneal_start) / (self.anneal_end - self.anneal_start)

It then scales each base learning rate accordingly:

return [base_lr * factor for base_lr in self.base_lrs]

Boundary space models the lower-dimensional quantum field theory (CFT).

The two linear mappings attempt to learn a correspondence or encode/decode scheme between these two dual descriptions.

Could be extended with nonlinearities, attention, or more complex architectures to better capture the AdS/CFT mapping.

Layer 3: Processes 128 to 256 channels, downsamples by stride=2.

Adaptive average pooling reduces spatial dimensions to 1x1.

Final fully connected layer maps 256 features to number of classes.

üìÅ File: topogan.py


---

üß† Purpose

topogan.py defines a topology-aware Generative Adversarial Network (TopoGAN) that integrates topological dynamics into the discriminator network. This helps the discriminator to capture and enforce topological constraints or properties on generated images.

The GAN consists of:

A Generator that maps latent vectors to images,

A Discriminator enhanced by a topological dynamics module to assess image validity,

A wrapping TopoGAN class encapsulating both.

        feats = self.conv(img)
        feats = feats.view(img.size(0), -1)
        validity = self.fc(feats)
        return validity

class TopoGAN(nn.Module):

        self.generator = Generator(latent_dim)
        self.discriminator = Discriminator()

    def forward(self, z):
        return self.generator(z)


---

üß† Detailed Explanation


---

1. Generator

class Generator(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, latent_dim=128, output_dim=28*28):

Takes a latent vector of size latent_dim (default 128).

Outputs a flattened image of size 28*28 = 784 (typical MNIST image size).



---

self.fc = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(latent_dim, 256),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(256, output_dim),
    nn.Tanh()
)

Two fully connected layers:

Map latent vector to 256 features, then apply ReLU.

Map 256 features to image dimension (28*28), apply Tanh to output in range [-1,1].




---

def forward(self, z):
    img = self.fc(z)
    img = img.view(z.size(0), 1, 28, 28)
    return img

Forward pass reshapes output into (batch_size, 1, 28, 28) ‚Äî a grayscale image.



---

2. Discriminator

class Discriminator(nn.Module):

Classifies images as real or fake.

Integrates a TopologicalDynamics module to transform input images before standard convolutional layers.



---

self.topo_dyn = TopologicalDynamics()

TopologicalDynamics is assumed to be a module that applies topological transformations or encodes topological features of images.



---

self.conv = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Conv2d(1, 64, 4, 2, 1), nn.LeakyReLU(0.2),
    nn.Conv2d(64, 128, 4, 2, 1), nn.LeakyReLU(0.2)
)

Two convolutional layers:

First: input 1 channel ‚Üí 64 channels, 4x4 kernel, stride 2, padding 1.

Second: 64 ‚Üí 128 channels, similar conv params.


Each followed by LeakyReLU with negative slope 0.2.



---

self.fc = nn.Linear(128*7*7, 1)

Fully connected layer maps flattened features to single scalar ‚Äî "validity" score.



---

def forward(self, img):
    img = self.topo_dyn(img)
    feats = self.conv(img)
    feats = feats.view(img.size(0), -1)
    validity = self.fc(feats)
    return validity

Forward pass:

Apply topological transformation to input image.

Extract features with CNN.

Flatten features and predict validity score.




---

3. TopoGAN Wrapper

class TopoGAN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, latent_dim=128):
        super().__init__()
        self.generator = Generator(latent_dim)
        self.discriminator = Discriminator()

    def forward(self, z):
        return self.generator(z)

Combines generator and discriminator.

forward only runs the generator (for inference or training generation step).

Training routines would separately run discriminator with real/fake images.



---

üîë Key Ideas and Usage

TopologicalDynamics module enhances discriminator by incorporating topological features, improving GAN's ability to learn meaningful structural properties beyond pixel-level.

Generator produces 28x28 images from latent noise vectors.

Discriminator classifies images with topology-informed features.

Useful in domains where topology or geometric structure matters (e.g., scientific imaging, structured data generation).



---

üß© Possible Extensions

Implement training loops for adversarial loss.

Provide TopologicalDynamics definition or import details.

Extend generator with convolutional layers for higher quality images.

Add noise injection or other GAN stabilization techniques.



Here's a comprehensive explanation and breakdown of quantumgpt.py with the full code and detailed insights:


---

üìÅ File: quantumgpt.py


---

üß† Purpose

quantumgpt.py implements a Quantum-inspired GPT-like Transformer decoder model, blending classical Transformer architecture with a quantum field encoding layer.

The model is designed for sequence modeling (e.g., language modeling, token prediction).

It integrates a QuantumField module to embed input token embeddings into a quantum field representation before decoding.

Uses a standard Transformer decoder stack for autoregressive prediction.

        super().__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, d_model)
        self.positional_encoding = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(1, 512, d_model))

        output = self.transformer_decoder(qfield_out, memory) if memory is not None else self.transformer_decoder(qfield_out, qfield_out)
        logits = self.fc_out(output)
        return logits


---

üß† Detailed Explanation


---

1. Class: QuantumGPT

This class defines a GPT-like Transformer decoder with quantum field embedding:

def __init__(self, vocab_size, d_model=512, nhead=8, num_layers=6):

vocab_size: number of tokens in vocabulary.

d_model: embedding and Transformer model dimension (default 512).

nhead: number of attention heads in each Transformer layer (default 8).

num_layers: number of Transformer decoder layers (default 6).



---

2. Embedding Layer

self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, d_model)

Maps input token indices to dense vectors of size d_model.



---

3. Positional Encoding

self.positional_encoding = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(1, 512, d_model))

Learned positional embeddings up to sequence length 512.

Added to token embeddings to inject position information.



---

4. Transformer Decoder

decoder_layer = TransformerDecoderLayer(d_model, nhead)
self.transformer_decoder = TransformerDecoder(decoder_layer, num_layers)

Stacks num_layers Transformer decoder layers.

Each layer performs multi-head self-attention and feed-forward transformations.



---

5. Quantum Field Module

self.quantum_field = QuantumField(field_dims=[1])

QuantumField is a quantum-inspired embedding layer (imported from core.quantum_field).

It processes the embeddings into a quantum field representation before decoding.

Typically, this could introduce richer, quantum-structured latent representations.



---

6. Output Projection

self.fc_out = nn.Linear(d_model, vocab_size)

Projects Transformer outputs back to vocabulary dimension for token prediction logits.



---

7. Forward Pass

def forward(self, tgt, memory=None):

tgt: input target token sequences (batch_size x seq_len).

memory: optional encoder memory input for Transformer decoder cross-attention.



---

embed = self.embedding(tgt) + self.positional_encoding[:, :tgt.size(1), :]

Embed tokens and add positional encodings.



---

qfield_out = self.quantum_field(embed)

Pass embeddings through quantum field encoder for quantum-enhanced representation.



---

output = self.transformer_decoder(qfield_out, memory) if memory is not None else self.transformer_decoder(qfield_out, qfield_out)

If memory (encoder output) is provided, use it for cross-attention.

Otherwise, use self-attention only (typical GPT style).



---

logits = self.fc_out(output)
return logits

Project decoder output to vocabulary logits for next-token prediction.



---

üîë Summary

QuantumGPT enhances classical Transformer decoders by preprocessing embeddings with a QuantumField module.

Intended for tasks like autoregressive language modeling or sequence generation.

Maintains typical GPT structure: token embeddings + positional encoding + Transformer decoder stack + linear output projection.

Optional encoder memory input allows use as a decoder in encoder-decoder models.

        # Execute
        job = execute(qc, self.backend, shots=1024)
        result = job.result()

        return torch.tensor(wavefunction, dtype=torch.cfloat)


---

üß© Explanation

1. Class: IBMQInterface

Manages connection to IBMQ backends.

Allows executing quantum circuits that simulate Hamiltonian evolution.



---

2. Initialization

def __init__(self, api_token, backend_name='ibmq_qasm_simulator'):

api_token: IBM Quantum Experience API token string.

backend_name: IBMQ backend to use, defaults to simulator 'ibmq_qasm_simulator'.

Stores token and backend info, initializes provider and backend as None.



---

3. Connect Method

def connect(self):
    IBMQ.save_account(self.api_token, overwrite=True)
    IBMQ.load_account()
    self.provider = IBMQ.get_provider(hub='ibm-q')
    self.backend = self.provider.get_backend(self.backend_name)
    return self.backend.status().operational

Saves and loads IBMQ account credentials.

Retrieves the provider and backend object.

Returns whether the backend is operational (ready to run jobs).



---

4. Execute Evolution Method

def execute_evolution(self, hamiltonian, state, time):

Simulates time evolution of a quantum state under a given Hamiltonian on IBM hardware:

hamiltonian: the Hamiltonian operator (assumed compatible with Qiskit).

state: initial quantum state vector as a list or tensor of complex amplitudes.

time: evolution time parameter.



---

Inside execute_evolution

Calculate number of qubits from length of state vector:


n_qubits = len(state) // 2

> Note: This assumes the state length is 2 * n_qubits, which may need adjustment depending on input format.




---

Create a quantum circuit with qubits and classical bits:


qc = QuantumCircuit(n_qubits, n_qubits)


---

State preparation ‚Äî initialize each computational basis state amplitude into the circuit:


for i, amp in enumerate(state):
    bin_str = format(i, f'0{n_qubits}b')
    qc.initialize({bin_str: amp}, range(n_qubits))

> This is not the usual way Qiskit‚Äôs initialize is used; typically initialize takes a statevector for all qubits, not a dictionary. This may need correction.




---

Hamiltonian evolution ‚Äî applies the Hamiltonian evolution unitary for time t:


qc.hamiltonian(hamiltonian, time, range(n_qubits))

> This method is not part of standard Qiskit and might represent a custom extension or pseudocode. In practice, one would use qiskit.opflow or qiskit.aqua to build time evolution circuits.




---

Execution and result retrieval:


job = execute(qc, self.backend, shots=1024)
result = job.result()
counts = result.get_counts(qc)

Run the circuit on the specified backend, then get the measurement counts.



---

Convert counts to approximate wavefunction:


total_shots = sum(counts.values())
wavefunction = [0] * (2**n_qubits)
for state_str, count in counts.items():
    idx = int(state_str, 2)
    wavefunction[idx] = count / total_shots

Counts frequencies approximate probabilities for computational basis states.

Convert those to amplitudes (non-negative real probabilities here, so complex phase info is lost).



---

Return tensor wavefunction


return torch.tensor(wavefunction, dtype=torch.cfloat)

Return a complex-valued torch tensor representing the (magnitude only) wavefunction.



---

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Caveats

The initialize call with a dict looks incorrect for Qiskit ‚Äî usually initialize(statevector, qubits) is used with a full vector.

qc.hamiltonian(...) is not a standard Qiskit API; typically Hamiltonian simulation requires decomposition into gates or use of Qiskit's opflow or evolution modules.

The wavefunction reconstruction from measurement counts ignores phase information, so the returned tensor is a probability distribution, not a full quantum state vector.

n_qubits = len(state)//2 seems questionable; state vectors for n qubits have length 2**n.

To run on real IBMQ hardware, error mitigation, transpilation, and queue management are required but not handled here.

This code snippet assumes access to IBMQ API and a proper token.



---

üîë Summary

ibmq.py wraps IBMQ quantum backend interaction to:

Connect and select a backend.

Prepare quantum circuits that simulate Hamiltonian evolution.

Run circuits and retrieve measurement results.

Convert measurements to an approximate wavefunction tensor for downstream quantum algorithm usage.


It serves as a bridge between classical code and IBM quantum hardware or simulators using Qiskit.

---

üß© Explanation

1. Class: GoogleQuantumInterface

Wraps around Cirq to either simulate or run Hamiltonian time evolution on Google's quantum hardware or simulator.

Abstracts processor connection and execution details.



---

2. Initialization

def __init__(self, processor_name='simulator'):
    self.processor_name = processor_name
    self.simulator = Simulator() if processor_name == 'simulator' else None

By default, the processor is set to "simulator" to run local simulation.

If a real quantum processor is specified, the simulator is not initialized.



---

3. Connect Method

def connect(self, processor=None):
    if processor:
        self.processor = processor
    return True

Accepts a real quantum processor interface if provided.

Otherwise, returns True indicating a successful "connection" (for simulator).

In real use, this could be extended to establish connections to actual hardware or cloud resources.



---

4. Execute Evolution Method

def execute_evolution(self, hamiltonian, state, time):

This method simulates or runs time evolution of a quantum state under a given Hamiltonian for a duration time.


---

Details inside execute_evolution

Number of qubits calculation


n_qubits = int(torch.log2(torch.tensor(len(state))))

Determines the number of qubits from the length of the initial state vector (len(state) = 2^n_qubits).



---

Create qubits and circuit


qubits = LineQubit.range(n_qubits)
circuit = cirq.Circuit()

Creates a line of qubits indexed from 0 to n_qubits-1.

Initializes an empty Cirq circuit.



---

State preparation


circuit.append(cirq.initialize(qubits, state))

Appends a state initialization operation to the circuit.

This prepares the system in the provided state vector.


> Note: Cirq‚Äôs initialize is a valid operation but in practice might require special handling for arbitrary states.




---

Hamiltonian evolution


for term, coeff in hamiltonian.terms():
    op = 1
    for q, pauli in term:
        op *= getattr(cirq, pauli)(qubits[q])
    circuit.append(cirq.PauliSumExponent(op, exponent=-time*coeff))

Iterates over the Hamiltonian terms.

Each term consists of a Pauli operator acting on specified qubits with a coefficient.

Builds the unitary evolution operator for each term as a Pauli exponentiation with parameter -time * coeff.

Appends these exponentials to the circuit for time evolution.



---

Execution


if self.processor_name != 'simulator':
    result = self.processor.run(circuit, repetitions=1000)
else:
    result = self.simulator.simulate(circuit)

If using real hardware, runs the circuit with 1000 shots to gather statistics.

Otherwise, simulates the circuit to get the final quantum state vector.



---

Result processing

If simulated, directly returns the final quantum state as a PyTorch complex tensor:


return torch.tensor(result.final_state_vector, dtype=torch.cfloat)

If run on hardware, reconstructs a probability wavefunction from measurement histograms:


wavefunction = [0] * (2**n_qubits)
for state_str, count in result.histogram(key='m'):
    idx = int(state_str, 2)
    wavefunction[idx] = count / 1000
return torch.tensor(wavefunction, dtype=torch.cfloat)


---

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Considerations

hamiltonian.terms() and the form of terms assumed here imply a custom Hamiltonian class with .terms() returning iterable (term, coeff) pairs.

The term is expected to be iterable of (qubit_index, 'X'/'Y'/'Z') tuples representing Pauli operators.

cirq.PauliSumExponent is not a standard Cirq function ‚Äî the real implementation might involve cirq.PauliString exponentiation (cirq.PauliString.exp).

This code does not handle decomposition of general Hamiltonians or Trotterization steps explicitly.

The state preparation and measurement on real hardware are simplified ‚Äî actual circuits might need more complex error mitigation.

result.histogram(key='m') assumes measurement results keyed by 'm', which requires measurement gates and keys to be defined properly.



---

üîë Summary

google_q.py provides a Google Quantum Interface using Cirq to:

Initialize quantum states.

Apply Hamiltonian time evolution via Pauli operator exponentiation.

Run on local simulator or real Google quantum processors.

Retrieve and convert results into usable PyTorch tensors representing quantum states or measurement probabilities.

üß© Explanation

1. Class: PhotonicQuantumInterface

An interface for running photonic quantum computations using the Strawberry Fields framework.

Supports Gaussian or other photonic backend devices.

Encodes the state and applies Hamiltonian evolution to photonic modes.



---

2. Initialization

def __init__(self, device='gaussian', cutoff_dim=10):
    self.device = device
    self.cutoff_dim = cutoff_dim

device: Specifies the photonic device backend, defaulting to 'gaussian' simulator.

cutoff_dim: The Hilbert space cutoff dimension for Fock basis truncation (photon number basis). Controls accuracy and resource usage.



---

3. Method: execute_evolution

def execute_evolution(self, hamiltonian, state, time):

Runs Hamiltonian time evolution on photonic hardware or simulator.



---

4. Program Initialization

prog = sf.Program(len(hamiltonian.modes))

Creates a Strawberry Fields quantum program with the number of modes equal to the modes specified in the Hamiltonian.



---

5. Context Block

with prog.context as q:

Defines the operations acting on the quantum modes q.



---

6. State Preparation

for i, amp in enumerate(state):
    if isinstance(amp, complex) and abs(amp) > 0:
        Fock(i) | q[0]

For each amplitude in the initial state, prepares the corresponding Fock state on mode 0 if amplitude is nonzero and complex.

Note: This snippet assumes all population is put into mode q[0] repeatedly, which may not prepare arbitrary multimode states correctly.



---

7. Hamiltonian Evolution

for term in hamiltonian.terms():
    if term[0][0] == 'X':
        Xgate(time * term[1]) | q[term[0][1]]
    elif term[0][0] == 'Z':
        Zgate(time * term[1]) | q[term[0][1]]
    elif term[0][0] == 'a^+a':
        Dgate(time * term[1]) | q[term[0][1]]

Applies photonic gates based on Hamiltonian terms:

Xgate corresponds to phase space displacement in the x-quadrature.

Zgate corresponds to phase space displacement in the p-quadrature.

Dgate corresponds to a general displacement operator (related to creation/annihilation operators).


Each gate is applied to the mode indexed by term[0][1], scaled by time * coeff.



---

8. Execution

eng = sf.Engine(self.device, backend_options={"cutoff_dim": self.cutoff_dim})
result = eng.run(prog)

Creates an engine for the chosen device/backend.

Runs the prepared quantum program.



---

9. Result Extraction

wavefunction = result.state.ket()
return torch.tensor(wavefunction, dtype=torch.cfloat)

Retrieves the final state vector (ket) from the photonic simulation.

Converts it into a PyTorch complex tensor for further use.



---

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Considerations

The current state preparation only acts on the first mode q[0]. For multimode states, state preparation logic needs extension.

hamiltonian.terms() should be compatible with this structure: terms are tuples with a description of operator and mode index, and coefficient.

Photonic gates here are simplified and only handle basic displacement operations; more complex Hamiltonians may require squeezing, rotation, or other photonic gates.

cutoff_dim controls the Fock space truncation and accuracy of the simulation‚Äîlarger values increase precision but consume more memory.



---

üîë Summary

photonic.py defines a photonic quantum interface for:

Initializing quantum states on photonic modes.

Applying Hamiltonian evolution using displacement-like gates (Xgate, Zgate, Dgate).

Running the quantum program on a photonic simulator or hardware backend supported by Strawberry Fields.

Returning the resulting quantum state as a PyTorch tensor for further quantum information or machine learning workflows.

\langle O \rangle = \langle \psi | O | \psi \rangle

Returns the real part of the expectation value (observable outcomes are real-valued).



---

‚öôÔ∏è Usage Overview

Instantiate Simulator.

Provide a Hamiltonian matrix , initial state vector , and evolution time .

Call execute_evolution to simulate the quantum state after time evolution.

        if self.step_count % self.frequency == 0:
            self.model.apply_renormalization()

‚úÖ Purpose:

Applies renormalization to the model periodically during training. This simulates a renormalization group (RG) flow, a key idea in quantum field theory to remove irrelevant high-frequency components and stabilize learning.

üßÆ Functionality:

frequency: Determines how often (in batches) the renormalization is applied.

on_batch_end(): Increments the step count and applies renormalization if the frequency condition is met.


üìå Model Requirement:

The model must have a method called apply_renormalization() defined, which executes the actual renormalization logic (e.g., suppressing noise or high-frequency modes).

    trainer.train_epoch(train_loader)
    val_loss, acc, entropy, betti = trainer.validate(test_loader)

Here is a comprehensive explanation of the homology_tracker.py module in the pytron_qft/visualization directory.


---

üìÑ File: homology_tracker.py

Location: pytron_qft/visualization/homology_tracker.py
Purpose: To compute and visualize the persistent homology of a wavefunction using topological data analysis (TDA) tools.


---

üß† Background

Persistent Homology is a tool in Topological Data Analysis (TDA) that captures the multi-scale topological features (like connected components, loops, voids) of a space. In the context of quantum physics:

A wavefunction can be interpreted as a probability distribution.

We can convert this distribution into a point cloud, and analyze its topological structure via Rips Complexes.

Persistence diagrams show when these features appear ("birth") and disappear ("death") at different thresholds.


This can give insights into the complexity and stability of quantum states.

üîß Function: track_homology

def track_homology(wavefunction, max_dim=2):
    """Compute and visualize persistent homology"""
    # Convert wavefunction to point cloud
    probs = wavefunction.abs().square().numpy()

    # Compute persistent homology
    rips = RipsComplex(points=point_cloud)
    st = rips.create_simplex_tree(max_dimension=max_dim)
    diag = st.persistence()
    
    # Plot persistence diagram
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
    plot_persistence_diagram(diag)
    plt.title("Persistence Diagram")
    plt.tight_layout()

X-axis: index
Y-axis: probability amplitude


3. Build Rips Complex:

rips = RipsComplex(points=point_cloud)
st = rips.create_simplex_tree(max_dimension=max_dim)
diag = st.persistence()
