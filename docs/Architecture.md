# Pytron-QFT Architecture

## Overview
Pytron-QFT is a quantum field theory inspired deep learning framework. It replaces traditional tensor operations with quantum field representations and operations.

## Core Components

### QuantumField
Represents data as excitations in a quantum field. Performs spectral transformations and renormalization.

### OperatorProduct
Implements operator algebra for quantum evolution. Supports Hamiltonian and unitary evolution.

### TopologicalDynamics
Incorporates persistent homology into wavefunction evolution.

### TensorNetwork
Efficiently represents high-dimensional wavefunctions using tensor networks.

### GeometricMeasurement
Projects quantum states onto curved manifolds for measurement.

## Training
- Path Integral Optimization: Quantum-inspired optimization algorithm.
- Renormalization Group Callbacks: Regularization via RG flow.

## Models
- FieldNet: Quantum field classifier.
- TopoGAN: GAN with topological loss.
- QuantumGPT: Language model with quantum attention.
