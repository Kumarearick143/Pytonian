# Quantum Field Theory for Machine Learning

## Key Concepts

### Quantum Fields
In QFT, fields are operator-valued distributions. Pytron-QFT represents data as excitations in learnable fields.

### Path Integrals
The framework uses Feynman path integrals for optimization and sampling.

### Renormalization
We apply renormalization group flow to control model complexity.

### Gauge Symmetries
Models can learn invariant representations via gauge symmetries.

### AdS/CFT Correspondence
Holographic principle allows encoding high-dimensional data in lower dimensions.

## Why QFT for ML?
- Natural handling of continuous symmetries
- Built-in regularization via renormalization
- Non-local correlations via entanglement
- Unified framework for classical and quantum data
